1. On MainPageController in Challan constructor we do need sum from popupwindow anyomore as it was required in
in case of paidqty.
	Example : 	
		Chalan chalan = new Chalan(productidtext.getText(), Integer.parseInt(issuetext.getText()), 0,
					Integer.parseInt(issuetext.getText()), Integer.parseInt(advancedpaidtext.getText()), AssigneeID,
					UTable.getPopupchallantablelist(),
					/*not required anymore as payment will be of that day*/ UTable.getTotalpaid(), 
					Integer.parseInt(receivetext.getText()),dateofbill,savechallandescription.getText());
